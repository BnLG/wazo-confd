        [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asterisk/asterisk/master/configs/samples/confbridge.conf.sample)
        for definitions:
        ```

            construct an average bitrate. If set to "lowest" the lowest maximum bitrate is
            forwarded to the sender. If set to "highest" the highest maximum bitrate is forwarded
            to the sender. If set to "average_all" a single average is generated from every
            receiver and the same value is sent to every sender. If set to "lowest_all" the lowest
            maximum bitrate of all receivers is sent to every sender. If set to "highest_all" the
            highest maximum bitrate of all receivers is sent to every sender. When set to "force",
            the value set in remb_estimated_bitrate is sent to every sender.
